# skating-database
Code used to scrape wikipedia to create a database of figure skating programs, using the package rvest.

Wikipedia does not always format one entry per cell and will sometimes have cells spanning multiple rows and sometimes have multiple rows inside one cell. The scrapers corrected for this and formated the data in a tidy dataframe.
